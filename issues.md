# Issues identified:

- the combinators have no names in their description. Before you had e.g. variable name in file defined at line x for all emitted combinators. Now the descriptions are just empty. This was always super useful for debugging and needs to be restored.
- wire merging is not working at all. Looking at how 00_wire_merge.fcdsl is compiled, you get some arithmetic combinators, but actually all of those should just be merged via wire merging into a single signal with value 100. So the output blueprint should have no combinators at all, just four constant combinators, three for the inputs and one for the total_A output.
- I think for some reason we are removing input and output constant combinators? Like the output signals that have no consumers are not emitted at all. This is wrong, because those are needed to output the signals from the circuit. Same for input constant combinators that have no consumers inside the circuit, they should still be emitted to provide the input signals.
- Relay power pole planting is way too complicated and broken. There are so many wholes in the final grid layout, there should be an easy way to just route the signal wires to where they need to go. The relays should ideally be planted inside the grid on a direct path between the entities that need power. A greedy approach should do just fine.
- There seems to be some issue in the more complex examples like 04_memory_advanced, because I get skipped wiring warnings: WARNING [unknown]: Skipped wiring for 'signal-W' due to missing placement (decider_15 -> mem_system_state_write_gate).
- The layout module is getting really complex and hard to maintain. We should think about refactoring it into smaller pieces or simplifying the logic where possible. There is a currently unused circuit optimizer module that could be integrated better. Could we just simplify the layout module, then pass the layout to the optimizer, and then have a simple final placement step in the emission? This should make sure that the optimizations are always not breaking anything in the layout and not modify the final behavior of the circuit. It should just optimize wiring that is not working because its too long, reduce the number of combinators where possible (e.g. by merging arithmetic combinators that do the same operation on the same inputs, wire merging or doing the current optimizations we already do for memory cells). Also the optimizer could do better power pole placement or rearange entities to reduce the number of power poles needed and the total wiring length.
