# Issues identified:

- the combinators have no names in their description. Before you had e.g. variable name in file defined at line x for all emitted combinators. Now the descriptions are just empty. This was always super useful for debugging and needs to be restored.
- wire merging is not working at all. Looking at how 00_wire_merge.fcdsl is compiled, you get some arithmetic combinators, but actually all of those should just be merged via wire merging into a single signal with value 100. So the output blueprint should have no combinators at all, just four constant combinators, three for the inputs and one for the total_A output.
- I think for some reason we are removing input and output constant combinators? Like the output signals that have no consumers are not emitted at all. This is wrong, because those are needed to output the signals from the circuit. Same for input constant combinators that have no consumers inside the circuit, they should still be emitted to provide the input signals.
- Relay power pole planting is way too complicated and broken. There are so many wholes in the final grid layout, there should be an easy way to just route the signal wires to where they need to go. The relays should ideally be planted inside the grid on a direct path between the entities that need power. A greedy approach should do just fine.
- why do we have a signal resolver? I think in general we want to always use the actual draftsman factorio signal names. We should not need this resolver at all. Instead, we should fix all occurences in our code where we use names that are not the ones from factorio. I do not mind, if we maintain a fixed list of virtual signals that we use for implicit signal types. Just have that list with signal-a to signal-9. And do away with all other names that are not factorio ones. To fix this, you can first fetch the full list of factorio signal names from factorio draftsman and then continue and fix all.
- somehow the virtual signals used in the compiler are not adhering to the maximum number of available signals. Factorio only has a limited number of virtual signal (36 or so? please check). Yet, we see such nonsense in the blueprint as signal-AE being used. This is definitely wrong and needs to be fixed. These signals do not exist. I want you to define a list of available virtual signals somewhere in common. This list is explicit and lists all available virtual signals. Then, whenever we need a new virtual signal, we pick the next one from that list. If we run out of signals, we error out (or come up with a clever way to reuse signals that are no longer in use, but that is an advanced feature we can skip for now).
