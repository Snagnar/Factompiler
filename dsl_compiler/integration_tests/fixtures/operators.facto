# Comprehensive operators fixture
# Tests: arithmetic, bitwise, logical, comparison operations

Signal a = 10;
Signal b = 5;

# Basic arithmetic
Signal sum = a + b;
Signal diff = a - b;
Signal prod = a * b;
Signal quot = a / b;
Signal rem = a % b;

# Power
Signal powered = 2 ** 4;

# Shift operations
Signal left = a << 2;
Signal right = a >> 1;

# Bitwise operations
Signal band = 0xFF AND 0x0F;
Signal bor = 0xF0 OR 0x0F;
Signal bxor = 0xFF XOR 0xAA;

# Comparison operations
Signal eq = a == b;
Signal ne = a != b;
Signal lt = a < b;
Signal le = a <= b;
Signal gt = a > b;
Signal ge = a >= b;

# Logical operations
Signal both = (a > 0) && (b > 0);
Signal either = (a > 0) || (b < 0);

# Unary operations
Signal negated = -a;
Signal notted = !a;

# Projection
Signal projected = a | "copper-plate";
