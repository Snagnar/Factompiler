# Test 25: Basic Bundle Operations
# Tests: Bundle literal, bundle arithmetic, bundle selection, any(), all()

# Create a bundle with multiple signal types
Bundle resources = { ("iron-plate", 100), ("copper-plate", 80), ("coal", 50) };

# Bundle arithmetic: multiply all signals by 2
Bundle doubled = resources * 2;

# Bundle arithmetic: add scalar to all signals
Bundle incremented = resources + 10;

# Bundle arithmetic: shift right all signals
Bundle shifted = resources >> 1;

# Extract a specific signal from the bundle
Signal iron = resources["iron-plate"];
Signal copper = resources["copper-plate"];

# Use any() for "any signal matches" comparison
Signal anyLow = any(resources) < 60;

# Use all() for "all signals match" comparison  
Signal allPositive = all(resources) > 0;

# Combine bundle operations with regular arithmetic
Signal ironDoubled = doubled["iron-plate"];
Signal total = ironDoubled + copper;
