# Test 0: Constant folding test
# Tests: All constant operations should fold to a single constant combinator
# Expression uses all operators and number bases, expected result: 23

# Precedence (highest to lowest):
# ** > * / % > + - > << >> > AND > XOR > OR
# 
# Computation:
# 2 ** 3 = 8
# 8 * 4 = 32
# 32 + 0x10 (16) = 48
# 48 - 0o5 (5) = 43
# 43 << 2 = 172
# 172 >> 1 = 86
# 86 AND 0b1111 (15) = 6
# --- OR binds loosest, so right side is computed separately ---
# 0x10 (16) XOR 0b0101 (5) = 21
# 6 OR 21 = 23

Signal test = 2 ** 3 * 4 + 0x10 - 0o5 << 2 >> 1 AND 0b1111 OR 0x10 XOR 0b0101;
